<h1>Groundnut Cultivation Process</h1>

<h2>1. Selecting the Right Location</h2>
<p>Choose a location with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Groundnuts prefer loose, sandy loam soil with good aeration.</p>

<h2>2. Soil Preparation</h2>
<p>Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing to loosen it. Remove any rocks, weeds, and debris. Groundnuts require well-drained soil to prevent waterlogging.</p>

<h2>3. Seed Selection</h2>
<p>Choose healthy, disease-free groundnut seeds. Groundnuts are typically grown from seeds (kernels) saved from the previous crop.</p>

<h2>4. Planting</h2>
<p>Plant groundnut seeds at a depth of about 2 inches (5 cm) and space them 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) apart within rows. Rows should be spaced about 24-36 inches (60-90 cm) apart.</p>

<h2>5. Watering</h2>
<p>Groundnuts need consistent moisture, especially during the flowering and pod development stages. Ensure that the soil is evenly moist but not waterlogged.</p>

<h2>6. Fertilization</h2>
<p>Apply a balanced fertilizer before planting or at the early growth stage. Groundnuts benefit from additional phosphorus and potassium.</p>

<h2>7. Weed Control</h2>
<p>Weeds can compete with groundnuts for nutrients and space. Practice regular weeding or use herbicides to control weed growth.</p>

<h2>8. Pest and Disease Management</h2>
<p>Monitor for pests like aphids and nematodes. Groundnuts are susceptible to fungal diseases. Use appropriate pesticides or organic methods for pest and disease control.</p>

<h2>9. Hilling</h2>
<p>Around 30 days after planting, mound soil around the base of the groundnut plants to provide additional support and improve aeration.</p>

<h2>10. Harvesting</h2>
<p>Groundnuts are usually ready for harvest in 120-150 days after planting. Harvest when the leaves turn yellow and the pods are mature. Gently pull the plants from the ground, and shake off excess soil.</p>

<h2>11. Drying and Curing</h2>
<p>Lay the harvested groundnut plants in the sun to dry for a few days. After drying, remove the pods from the plants.</p>

<h2>12. Shelling</h2>
<p>Shell the pods to separate the groundnuts from the shells.</p>

<h2>13. Post-Harvest Handling</h2>
<p>Store the groundnuts in a cool, dry place to prevent mold and insect infestation. Proper storage can extend their shelf life.</p>

<p>Groundnuts are a valuable source of protein and oil. The cultivation process may vary based on the specific groundnut variety and local conditions, so it's important to adapt these steps to your specific needs and location.</p>
