    <h1>Rice Cultivation Guide</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the Right Location:
            <p>Choose a well-drained, level field with access to a water source. Ensure proper water management is possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Soil Preparation:
            <p>Plow or till the soil, incorporate organic matter, and level the field to create a smooth seedbed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Seed Selection:
            <p>Choose high-quality rice seeds suitable for your region and climate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Seedbed Preparation:
            <p>Create a seedbed by broadcasting rice seeds in a prepared nursery or a well-soaked seedbed. Keep the seedbed consistently moist.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Transplanting (for most rice varieties):
            <p>Transplant seedlings into the main field, maintaining proper spacing between seedlings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Flooding the Field:
            <p>Flood the field with water after transplanting, ensuring consistent water depth (typically 2-4 inches).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Weed Control:
            <p>Regularly check for and control weeds through hand weeding or herbicides.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Fertilization:
            <p>Apply fertilizers based on soil testing recommendations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Disease and Pest Management:
            <p>Monitor for diseases and pests and take appropriate control measures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Irrigation:
            <p>Maintain proper water management throughout the growing season, especially during flowering and grain-filling stages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Harvesting:
            <p>Harvest when the grains have matured and the plants have turned straw-colored.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Drying and Threshing:
            <p>Dry harvested rice and thresh to separate grains from stalks and husks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Winnowing and Milling:
            <p>Winnow to remove chaff and impurities and mill the rice as needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Storage:
            <p>Store the rice in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture and insect damage.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
