Intercropping rice with wheat can be beneficial as it maximizes land usage and enhances productivity. Here's a general overview of intercropping procedures for rice and wheat:

1. **Preparation of Land:**
   - Ensure the field is well-prepared with proper irrigation facilities as both rice and wheat have different water requirements.
   - The soil should be well-drained to prevent waterlogging for rice and well-aerated for wheat.

2. **Sowing Seeds:**
   - For rice, seeds are usually sown in a puddled field, while wheat requires a well-prepared seedbed.
   - Rice is typically transplanted, whereas wheat seeds are directly sown.

3. **Planting Pattern:**
   - Arrange the crops in rows or patterns that optimize space and sunlight exposure for both rice and wheat.
   - Generally, rice can be planted in rows spaced wider apart to accommodate the later sowing of wheat between them.

4. **Crop Management:**
   - Monitor and manage the growth stages of both crops. For instance, rice requires more water during its initial growth phase (tillering), while wheat might require less water.

5. **Weed and Pest Control:**
   - Employ effective weed and pest control measures suitable for both rice and wheat without affecting each other's growth.
   - Use crop-specific methods to avoid damage to either crop.

6. **Harvesting:**
   - Harvesting times for rice and wheat differ. Rice is typically harvested earlier than wheat.
   - Carefully harvest one crop without causing damage to the other.

7. **Post-Harvest Management:**
   - Properly store and manage the harvested crops according to their respective storage requirements.

Remember, successful intercropping depends on factors like soil quality, climate, crop varieties chosen, and proper management techniques. It's often beneficial to consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for region-specific advice on intercropping rice with wheat.
