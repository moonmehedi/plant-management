Jute cultivation involves growing jute plants for their natural fibers. This eco-friendly crop requires a warm and humid climate, well-distributed rainfall, and alluvial soil. The process includes land preparation, sowing seeds, plant care, and harvesting. After harvesting, the jute fibers are extracted, processed, and used to make various products like sacks, ropes, textiles, and more. Jute cultivation has economic importance, environmental benefits, and contributes to sustainable agriculture.
