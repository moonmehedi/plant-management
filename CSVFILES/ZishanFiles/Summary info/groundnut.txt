Here's a concise summary of the groundnut (peanut) cultivation process:

1. **Location:** Choose well-drained, sunny areas with sandy loam soil.

2. **Soil Prep:** Plow and clear soil of rocks and weeds to prevent waterlogging.

3. **Seed Selection:** Pick healthy, disease-free seeds, usually saved from the previous crop.

4. **Planting:** Plant seeds 2 inches deep, spaced 2-4 inches apart within rows, with rows 24-36 inches apart.

5. **Watering:** Maintain consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development.

6. **Fertilization:** Apply balanced fertilizer with extra phosphorus and potassium.

7. **Weed Control:** Manage weeds through regular weeding or herbicides.

8. **Pest and Disease Control:** Monitor for pests and diseases, using organic or chemical methods.

9. **Hilling:** At around 30 days, mound soil around plants for support.

10. **Harvesting:** Harvest when leaves turn yellow, pods mature. Gently pull plants and remove excess soil.

11. **Drying and Curing:** Dry harvested plants in the sun for a few days and remove pods.

12. **Shelling:** Separate groundnuts from shells.

13. **Storage:** Store groundnuts in a cool, dry place to prevent mold and insect infestation.

Groundnuts are rich in protein and oil and can be adapted to local conditions and varieties.
