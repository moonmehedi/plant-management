Bacterial Blight
->Check for wilting and yellowing of leaves, or wilting of seedlings (also called kresek).
->On seedlings, infected leaves turn grayish green and roll up. As the disease progresses, the leaves turn yellow to straw-colored and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die.
->Kresek on seedlings may sometimes be confused with early rice stem borer damage.
->To distinguish kresek symptoms from stem borer damage, squeeze the lower end of infected seedlings between the fingers. Kresek symptoms should show yellowish bacterial ooze coming out of the cut ends. Unlike plants infested with stem borer, rice plants with kresek are not easily pulled out from soil.
