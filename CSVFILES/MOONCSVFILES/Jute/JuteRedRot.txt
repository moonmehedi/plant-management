Red Rot (caused by Fusarium species):
Discoloration: The internal tissues of the stem show a characteristic red discoloration.
Rotting: The infected stem portion becomes soft, rots, and often emits a foul smell.
Wilting: Above the infected stem section, the foliage may wilt, especially in severe infections.
Stunted Growth: Infected plants may show reduced height and stunted growth due to the deterioration of the vascular system.
Leaf Symptoms: Leaves may turn yellow and shed prematurely if the infection is severe, affecting the overall photosynthesis of the plant.
