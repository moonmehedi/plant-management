Jute Anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum corchorum):
Leaf Spots: Initial symptoms include small, water-soaked spots on leaves that can expand to larger brown or black necrotic lesions.
Lesion Expansion: The lesions may grow and coalesce to create larger areas of dead tissue, often with a concentric ring pattern typical of Colletotrichum infections.
Fruit and Flower Infection: Although jute is primarily cultivated for its fibers, its fruits and flowers can also show symptoms with dark, sunken lesions when infected.
Defoliation: Severely infected leaves can become yellow, wither, and fall off prematurely, potentially leading to significant defoliation.
Stem Lesions: Dark, sunken lesions may also appear on stems, which can girdle the stem and lead to weakening or breaking, particularly at the nodes.
