Stem Rot (caused by Macrophomina phaseolina):
Blackening of Base: The base of the stem turns black and may show a charcoal-like appearance due to the presence of microsclerotia.
Dry Rot: Unlike Red Rot, Stem Rot typically leads to a dry, brittle consistency in the affected areas of the stem.
Cankers: Sunken, dark cankers can develop on the stem, often at the soil line or just above.
Wilting: Foliage may wilt due to impaired water and nutrient transport through the damaged stem.
Root Symptoms: Roots may also be affected, showing signs of rotting and blackening, further weakening the plant.
