Yellow Mosaic (caused by the Jute Yellow Mosaic Virus (JYMV)):
Mosaic Patterns: Yellow and green mosaic patterns appear on the leaves, with irregular patches of yellowing.
Leaf Deformation: Leaves might show signs of curling, wrinkling, or malformation.
Stunted Growth: Plants with Yellow Mosaic often exhibit stunted growth and reduced vigor due to impaired photosynthesis.
Reduced Yield: Infected jute plants may produce fewer and weaker fibers, significantly impacting the quality and quantity of the yield.
Spread Pattern: The disease often spreads rapidly through the field, as it is typically vector-borne, transmitted by insects like whiteflies.
